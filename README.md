# postman
this client was started for fun as a project to help with my java and coding in general. i started getting into coding around July of 2020 and a project like this is perfect, not only for fun, but to help me out. postman originally started as a private project with roots stemming from my previous project, Present, i decided to make postman a public project on Halloween 2020, the original set release date for Present Utility Mod. :)

postman is a client for Minecraft 1.12.2 intended for use on servers which allow client-side modification. this client is not intended for and is of no use on servers which do not allow it. postman takes inspiration from both a few clients listed in the credits below, and uses Zeros Alpine for an event system and lukflugs panelstudio for the clickGui, so thank you to all mentioned! this wouldn't be possible without them. i intend for this project to be as community driven as possible, no private access, no private development, every beta release is public and free to use! and with this GitHub, the client is now officially open source.

this client is on Minecraft 1.12.2, Forge version 1.12.2-14.23.5.2768, Alpine 1.5, PanelStudio 0.1.2, and is coded in 100% java.
